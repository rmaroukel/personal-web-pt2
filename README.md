# The process
**Starting Point**
- Started with basic HTML and CSS files (index.html, style.css)
- Created Nav bar, body, & footer.
- Uploaded to github as "template"

**Considering Tailwind CSS**
- Became curious about finding easier methods of implenting CSS as a component
- Researched online and came across Tailwind
- Reviewed tutorials and official documentation to determine useability

**Adding Tailwind CSS**
- Implementation did not seem too daunting, so I ventured to add Tailwind to my project
- Installed [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Added Tailwind Config file
- Added Tailwind output.css file (custom css to override Tailwind)

**Stylized pages & added content**
- Implemented block rubric requirements

**Added webpack to create production ready files**
- Installed [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- Added webpack.config.js to handle file paths and webpack plugins
- Added postcss.config.js file to handle Tailwind css structure

**Created free web hosting domain**
- Used [infinityfree.com](https://www.infinityfree.com/) to create a hosted domain
- Uploaded production files to FTP using [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)
